        <p>Welcome to Yusuf Cafe!<br>
        The Cafe was founded in Dublin by Mr. Yusuf. At Yusuf Cafe, we believe that coffee is more than just a drink. It's an experience from that first sip to kickstart your morning to the last cup of the day. Our coffee follows you through the day. We match you with the most suitable flavor to satisfy your senses, so you can sip, savor, and repeat.<br>
        <br>
        In addition to our full espresso and brew bar menu, we serve fresh made-to-order breakfast and lunch sandwiches, as well as a selection of sides and salads and other good stuff. <br>
        <br>
        "Use products from nature for what it's worth - but never too early, nor too late." Fresh is the new sweet.<br>
        Chef, Coffeeist, and Owner: Yusuf Omotayo Fetuga<br>
        We are located in the heart of Dublin.<br>
